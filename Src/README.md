# Tests

Test folder contains unit/module tests. In order to test some specific functionality, 
exclude main.c file from build and include test file. E.g. include 001_Printf.c. All other
files in Tests folder should be excluded and only one should be included. It's possible to
change test files to your needs. All tests files will be, by default, excluded from the build.
